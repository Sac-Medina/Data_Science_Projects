A short-term temperature forecast is created

The script is : Hamburg_temperatures_forecasts.ipynb

The code:
-Use temperature data from www.ecad.eu

-Builds a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality

-Plots and inspect the different components of a time series

-Models time dependence of the remainder using an AR model

-Compares the statistical output of different AR models

-Redicts temperature one day in future
