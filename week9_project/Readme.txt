Building a Neural Network with Keras to predictions of images of handwritten digits.

The script is : neuronal_complex.ipynb

The code 
- uses  keras pre-built image dataset of handwritten digits
- trains a neural network (2 convolutional layers, flatten layer, dropout layer, hiden layers, batch normalization)
- saves the neural network model results
- makes number predictions using ".jpg" files
